TJ's split terminal thing

Something other than the iterm theme in wezterm

The linter still isn't 100% there, the custom no string thing isn't there yet

Figure out a splitting workflow

modularize lazy-plugins

I remember seeing a quote/paren/bracket autocomplete that I wanted.
It's called mini.pairs

Git diff workflow might be improvable?
